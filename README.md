Brightside nodes store the social graph used by the Brightside social platform.

Mobile devices send nodes updates to the graph.

By analyzing this graph, Brightside nodes are able to evaluate a user's likelihood of being unique. Other applications--such as a Basic Income application--make requests to a Brightside node to retrieve this information.

Node operators may earn money by setting fees for their services.
