# Brightside

Brightside is a public [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger).  Instead of being secured by a blockchain (proof-of-work or proof-of-stake), it's secured by a social graph of face-to-face connections.

As a side-effect of its security model, Brightside maintains in its ledger a list of public keys representing unique individuals.  Applications built on Brightside have access to this list.  This makes Brightside a good fit for applications where each user represents a unique person--such as social networks, universal basic income distribution systems, and voting systems.
