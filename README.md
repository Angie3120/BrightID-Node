BrightID nodes store the social graph used by BrightID.

By analyzing this graph, BrightID nodes are able to evaluate a user's likelihood of being unique. Other applications--such as a Basic Income application--make requests to a BrightID node to retrieve this information.  (See [BrightID Service](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Service).)
