Brightside nodes store the social graph used by Brightside. Mobile devices send them updates to the graph.

By analyzing this graph, a Brightside node is able to determine whether or not a person can be verified as unique. When another application--such as a Basic Income application--wants to know whether a user is a unique individual in their system, they make a request to a Brightside node. Brightside nodes protect systems against fake or duplicate accounts, known as sybils. Node operators may earn money for their services.
