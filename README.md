# BrightID Node

BrightID nodes store the social graph used by [BrightID](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID).

By analyzing this graph, BrightID nodes are able to evaluate a user's likelihood of being unique. Other applications make requests to a BrightID node to retrieve this information.  (See [BrightID API](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-API).)
