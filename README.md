Brightside is a decentralized service that allows applications to verify that users are unique individuals.

This is important to a variety of applications, including basic income, voting, membership, records and credential management, and charities.

## Components
### Interaction Client
The Brightside interaction client runs on mobile devices and records face-to-face interactions. These interactions form the basis for establishing someone's uniqueness.

Individuals use the interaction client to grant third-party applications the right to verify their uniqueness.

### Interaction API
Third-party applications interface with the Brightside interaction client running on the same device to retrieve a public key associated with the user.
### Uniqueness Verification Service
An application pushes a public key obtained through the interaction API to one or more Brightside nodes, which then perform a verification check and publish the result.

## How it Works
Brightside nodes store pairs of interactions, forming a social graph. By analyzing this graph, a node is able to determine whether or not a person can be verified as unique. When another application, such as a Basic Income application wants to know whether a user is a unique individual in their system, they push a request to a Brightside node. There are several methods available to nodes to handle these requests. Brightside nodes protect systems against fake or duplicate accounts, known as _sybils_. Node operators may earn money for their services.
